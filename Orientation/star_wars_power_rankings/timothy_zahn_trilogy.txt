I have always been disappointed that Lucasfilm never did anything with Timothy Zahn's excellent trilogy, which introduced Thrawn, Mara Jade, and quite a few other compelling characters. On top of the standard reasons why people don't like the prequel trilogy, it also contradicted some aspects of creating clones, which made the Zahn trilogy non-canonical, and therefore all anyone could do was nab specific characters (most notably Thrawn) to be used in other stories.
