I agree, TLJ and TROS, while having some very visually striking cinematography, just did not feel like Star Wars to me. Maybe that is how people older than me felt while watching the prequels... I much prefer the EU material. Imagine how cool it would have been if they would have made a Thrawn trilogy with Sebastian Stan as Luke!
